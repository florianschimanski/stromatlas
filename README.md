# Strom Atlas

The Electricity Atlas ([Strom Atlas](https://stromatlas.info)) takes a critical look at electricity generation in Germany: Who produces the electricity - and where? What differences are there between urban and rural areas, west and east, past and present? Who owns the power stations? And how fairly is the transition to renewable energies organised? 

The website uses data from the Federal Network Agency ([Bundesnetzagentur](https://www.bundesnetzagentur.de/DE/Home/home_node.html)) to show how closely electricity is linked to issues of power, ownership and political organisation. It is intended to help us rethink connections and create a basis for discussion on what a democratic and ecological energy future could look like.
